This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common error: ZeroDivisionError. The function takes two arguments and returns their quotient. However, it does not handle the case where the denominator is zero. This leads to a ZeroDivisionError when the function is called with a denominator of zero. The solution shows how to handle the error using a try-except block.
